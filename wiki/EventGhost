[http://www.eventghost.org EventGhost] is a open-source automation tool for Windows, which can be extended with plugins.
It is possible to use varius controllers as remote controllers to trigger macros, which then controlls a computer and its connected peripherals. When the user has configured everything needed, the software runs in the background and waits for an event. It is for example possible to controll a Media-PC with a normal remote control.

Example of events:
 * Hotkeys
 * Another software starts
 * Another software (e.g. EventGhost on another computer), Girder or Netremote sends an event over TCP/IP
 * A specific HTTP-request, made to the built in webserver
 * Another software sending an event by ActiveX

Exempel of things to control:
 * Controlling lights etc. wirelessly with a TellStick!
 * Start a program on the computer
 * Emulate a keypress
 * Control the soundcard
 * Move and resize a window
 * Send IR commands to other peripherals
