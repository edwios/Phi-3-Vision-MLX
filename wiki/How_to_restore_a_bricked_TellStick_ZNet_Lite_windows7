== How to restore a bricked TellStick Net v2, TellStick ZNet Lite (v1), or TellStick ZNet Lite v2 ==
Did something happen during a firmware upgrade of your TellStick? And now it won't start again?[[BR]]
Don't worry! You can probably restore it again yourself.

If something goes wrong while upgrading the firmware in the TellStick, you'll need to put it into failsafe mode. It will then start a web browser at ip address 192.168.97.60 and it's possible to upload a new firmware there. You will need to join the same network on your computer and upload the firmware.

'''Please note: It's very important that you download the correct firmware for your product! '''[[BR]]
The firmware can be downloaded here: [[BR]][[BR]]

Disconnect the power to TellStick[[BR]]
Press and hold the button next to the USB-connector, using a paperclip or other sharp object.[[BR]]
Connect the power again.[[BR]]
The middle LED should now flash four times. First flash should be longer and then three shorter flashes. Release the button after the fourth flash. [[BR]]
The middle LED will now confirm by flashing fast for one second.[[BR]]


The computer must exist on the same subnet as TellStick ZNet Lite. To do this we need to change the computers ip-address. Open {{{Control Panel}}} > {{{Network and Internet}}} > {{{Network and Sharing Center}}} > click {{{Change adapter settings}}} in the left side.[[BR]]
Right click on the network adapter that you are using and choose {{{Properties}}}.

Select {{{Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)}}} and click {{{Properties}}}.[[BR]]

Select {{{Use the following IP address}}} and enter the IP address {{{192.168.97.61}}} and the subnet mask {{{255.255.255.0}}}.[[BR]]
[[Image(ip_address_w7.png, nolink)]][[BR]]

Click {{{OK}}} and then {{{Close}}} on the previous dialog to close them and set the new address.

Open a web browser and navigate to http://192.168.97.60/ [[BR]][[Br]]
[[Image(firmware_update.png, nolink)]][[BR]]

[[BR]] Click "Browse..." and select the .bin file you downloaded earlier.[[BR]]
Click "Update firmware".[[BR]][[BR]]

The firmware will now upgrade and the device will reboot, it might take a couple of minutes. [[BR]]
Note: The web browser will not tell when the upgrade is finished, so just close the browser. 

'''Remember to restore the previous settings in {{{Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)}}} or you won't get Internet access.'''
