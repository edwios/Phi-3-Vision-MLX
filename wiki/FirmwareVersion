== TellStick ZNet Lite v1 & v2, TellStick Net v2 ==
''Changes in version 1.3.3 (being rolled out now)''[[BR]]

Bugfixes:
* Tighter control over plugin names. Names are now restricted to only alphanumeric characters, space and hyphen.
* Fixed a bug in plugin configuration value handling that prevented the field from being corrected.
* Fixed a bug in plugin configuration value that led to unusable min and max values.

''Changes in version 1.3.2''[[BR]]

Bugfixes:
* It's now possible to add a group from the API (not only the web interface)
* "Last updated" may now be included from a sensor API call ("info" and "list")
* Battery level is now included in sensor info API call, if any
* Allow Lifx plugin correctly through the firewall
* Allow UPnP correctly through the firewall
* Allow local API requests to be sent using "POST"
* Fixed: Handle DST changes for time triggers
* Fixed: Suntime triggers that didn't work after a period of midnight sun or polar night
* Fixed: Suntime condition. Make sure the sun is considered "up" in conditions even if the sun sets and rises again in the same day (before 00:00 UTC)
* Fixed: Failures in Device history. Sometimes failed commands where not included in the device history (for example when not being able to run a schedule after several attempts), and in other cases fails could be listed as success in the device history, and in yet other cases the origin of a command was incorrect on failed commands
* Fixed: In some circumstance sensors where not set as ignored in user interface, even if they where actually ignored
* Fixed: Blockheater was not always calculated correctly on the first day of the month
* Fixed: Multiple entries in device history when controlling TZWP102
* Lots of thermostat fixes, including:
    - Correct handling of sending commands to non-listening thermostats (thermostats with batteries)
    - Better messages in device history when changing mode or temperature
    - Fix problem when including thermostat as secure
    - Handle negative temperatures
    - Correct and consistent handling of thermostat reports
    - Wait for a report back from the thermostat, before updating status/temperature in the user interface
    - Don't change "mode" in a command if not explicitly asked to

Known issues:
* Some types of failed device state changes will be logged twice in the device history until after a server upgrade
