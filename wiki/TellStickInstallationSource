== TellStick installation - Linux ==

The Linux installation of TellStick requires kernel version 2.6.14 or later. You will also need support for the driver  {{{ftdi_sio}}}.

To find out which version of the kernel you are running, use this command:
{{{
#!sh
uname -r
}}}

=== Prerequisites ===
In order to build the software under Linux some softwares is required. You need at least the following:

gcc (compiler) and a working toolchain.
 On debian systems, this can be installed by installing the package {{{build-essential}}}
libftdi (and the corresponding development package)
 Called {{{libftdi1}}} and {{{libftdi-dev}}} on debian
libconfuse (and the corresponding development package)
 Called {{{libconfuse0}}} and {{{libconfuse-dev}}} on debian
cmake

=== Using kernel 2.6.21 or later ===

If you are using kernel version later than 2.6.21 you need to make sure the kernel module ftdio_sio is not loaded in the kernel.

Check if the module is loaded into the kernel by:
{{{
#!sh
lsmod | grep ftdi_sio
}}}

If it is loaded, unload with:
{{{
#!sh
modprobe -r ftdi_sio
}}}

=== Installing the software ===

Download the latest source code from Telldus at:
[http://download.telldus.com/TellStick/Software/telldus-core/telldus-core-2.1.2.tar.gz] (beta here: [http://download.telldus.com/pool/main/t/telldus-core/telldus-core_2.1.3-beta1.orig.tar.gz] )

Unpack it:
{{{
#!sh
cd /usr/src
gunzip telldus-core-{version}.tar.gz #Change {version} to the downloaded version
tar xvf telldus-core-{version}.tar
}}}

This creates the directory /usr/src/telldus-core-{version} containing the files
from the archive. We only support the GNU version of tar archiving utility. Note
on some systems it is called gtar.

Go to the new directory
{{{
#!sh
cd telldus-core
}}}

==== Configuring ====

Telldus Core is built using CMake (http://www.cmake.org), version 2.6.0 is the
minimum required version. This means there is no configure-script, but you
need to run cmake.

To configure telldus-core for your machine type:
{{{
#!sh
cmake .
}}}
in the package directory.

By default, Telldus Core is configured for installation in the /usr/local
directory, but this can be changed by using the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
option. Alternatively, the DESTDIR="/opt" option can be used to specify a "local"
installation within the source directory when running "make install".

==== Building ====
To create the library and compile all the tools type:

{{{
#!sh
make
}}}

If you did not configure Telldus Core using the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr
option, you need to install the library and tools in the appropriate place. To
do this, type:

{{{
#!sh
su -c "make install"
}}}

and enter the root password.

If you want to install in another directory, type:

{{{
#!sh
su -c "make DESTDIR=/opt install"
}}}

Note that on some systems the make utility is named differently, e.g. {{{gmake}}}.

On some systems the cache for libraries need to be updated, type:
{{{
#!sh
su -c "ldconfig"
}}}

=== Configuring the receivers === 

After the compilation is done, go on and [wiki:TellStick_conf "configure"] the receivers, or install TelldusCenter to configure them in an graphical environment.
