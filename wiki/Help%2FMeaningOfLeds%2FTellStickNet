''From firmware 3, the LEDs in TellStick Net describes the current status:''

In normal operation, when not sending or receiving, the side LEDs are not lit, but the network port should have a steady yellow light, and the green light should blink occasionally.

If the network LEDs are not lit, please check power and ethernet connections.[[BR]][[BR]]
