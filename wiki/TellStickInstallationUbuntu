== GUI installation (recommended) ==

The following is the recommended way of installing Telldus software for Ubuntu and Debian. This is not the most stripped down approach but it is the safest and most simplistic.

=== Adding the Telldus Key ===

These packages are signed with a unique key for added security. Synaptic needs to know this key in order to verify the packages' authenticity.
 * Download the following file: http://download.telldus.com/debian/telldus-public.key
 * From the Desktop, click System -> Administration -> Software Sources.
 * Click the "Autentication" tab.
 * Click "Import Key File" and choose the downloaded file and press OK.

 * If any problems occur during the key import, please add the key by running this instead:
{{{
sudo apt-key add telldus-public.key
}}}

=== Adding the Telldus Repository ===

Adding the Telldus Repository tells your system where to look for software from Telldus for installation and future updates
 * From the Desktop, click System -> Administration -> Software Sources.
 * Click the "Third Party Sofware" tab.
 * Click "Add". For the Apt line type the following:
  {{{deb http://download.telldus.com/debian/ stable main}}}
Note, use "unstable" for now for Debian 9 based distributions.
 * Click "Close".

=== Installing telldus-core ===

Now that the repository and key have been added, install telldus-core like any other program.
 * Click System -> Administration -> Synaptic Package Manager
 * Click "Reload"
 * Search for "telldus-core"
 * Mark telldus-core for installation and mark additional changes when prompted.
 * Click "Apply" and agree to the changes after reading them.
 * telldus-core is now installed and ready for use.

=== Installing TelldusCenter ===

To control or manage your devices via GUI, and allow connection to Telldus Live!, repeat the above
steps for 'tellduscenter'. This package also requires 'libtelldus-core2' and 'libtelldus-gui2'.

== Console based installation ==

Add the following lines to your {{{/etc/apt/sources.list}}}:
{{{
deb http://download.telldus.com/debian/ stable main
}}}

The Telldus public key for apt-secure can be downloaded [http://download.telldus.com/debian/telldus-public.key here]. You can add this key with
{{{
sudo apt-key add telldus-public.key
}}}

or combine downloading and registering:
{{{
wget -q http://download.telldus.com/debian/telldus-public.key -O- | sudo apt-key add -
}}}

The key fingerprint is
{{{
70C4 10C9 D73D 53E8 38B3 1C58 5A94 9181 E501 EA76
Telldus Technologies AB <info.tech@telldus.se>
}}}

Update the repository
{{{
sudo apt-get update
}}}

To install telldus-core, do
{{{
sudo apt-get install telldus-core
}}}

== Configuring ==

After the installation of telldus-core, go on and [wiki:TellStick_conf "configure"] the receivers.

== Beta code ==
If you want to try the latest beta software, also add the following to {{{/etc/apt/sources.list}}}:

'''Note! This is not recommended if your are not a developer wanting to help us test new code. It is called unstable for a reason! '''
{{{
deb http://download.telldus.com/debian/ unstable main
}}}
