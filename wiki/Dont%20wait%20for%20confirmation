= Don't wait for confirmation from TellStick =

=== Background ===
Older TellStick batches do not send back confirmation after on/off has been sent. To allow for status update, and avoid the "An error occurred while communicating with TellStick"-error, please activate this setting. ''This setting was added in version 2.1.1 of our software.''
