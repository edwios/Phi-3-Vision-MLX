== How to restore a bricked TellStick Net v2, TellStick ZNet Lite (v1), or TellStick ZNet Lite v2 ==
Did something happen during a firmware upgrade of your TellStick? And now it won't start again?[[BR]]
Don't worry! You can probably restore it again yourself.

If something goes wrong while upgrading the firmware in the TellStick, you'll need to put it into failsafe mode. It will then start a web browser at ip address 192.168.97.60 and it's possible to upload a new firmware there. You will need to join the same network on your computer and upload the firmware.

'''Please note: It's very important that you download the correct firmware for your product! '''[[BR]]
The firmware can be downloaded here: [[BR]][[BR]]
