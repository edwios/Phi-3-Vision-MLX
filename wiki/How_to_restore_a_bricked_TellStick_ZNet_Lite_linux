== How to restore a bricked TellStick Net v2, TellStick ZNet Lite (v1), or TellStick ZNet Lite v2 ==
Did something happen during a firmware upgrade of your TellStick? And now it won't start again?[[BR]]
Don't worry! You can probably restore it again yourself.

If something goes wrong while upgrading the firmware in the TellStick, you'll need to put it into failsafe mode. It will then start a web browser at ip address 192.168.97.60 and it's possible to upload a new firmware there. You will need to join the same network on your computer and upload the firmware.

'''Please note: It's very important that you download the correct firmware for your product! '''[[BR]]
The firmware can be downloaded here: [[BR]][[BR]]

Disconnect the power to TellStick[[BR]]
Press and hold the button next to the USB-connector, using a paperclip or other sharp object.[[BR]]
Connect the power again.[[BR]]
The middle LED should now flash four times. First flash should be longer and then three shorter flashes. Release the button after the fourth flash. [[BR]]
The middle LED will now confirm by flashing fast for one second.[[BR]]


Join the sub-network by adding an IP alias. Type the command: [[BR]]
sudo ifconfig eth0:0 192.168.97.6 [[BR]]
Replace eth0 with the interface you are using.[[BR]][[BR]]

Open a web browser and navigate to http://192.168.97.60/ [[BR]][[Br]]

[[BR]] Click "Browse..." and select the .bin file you downloaded earlier.[[BR]]
Click "Update firmware".[[BR]][[BR]]

The firmware will now upgrade and the device will reboot, it might take a couple of minutes. [[BR]]
Note: The web browser will not tell when the upgrade is finished, so just close the browser.
